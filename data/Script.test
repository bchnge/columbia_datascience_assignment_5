      INT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY

       Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by
       the elevator.  Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the
       stairs.  Hears the elevator cage start from below.

       Thinking fast, he wrenches open the steel gate, leans into
       the lift shaft, watches the elevator COUNTERWEIGHT as it
       comes down.  Almost nonchalant, he steps out...

       INT. STAIRWELL/ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

       As the cageful of police rises, Bond is now standing on the
       counterweight, DESCENDING.

       EXT. STREET - GENEVA

       Lunchtime.  Faceless business crowds heading for their brief
       moment of freedom, among them we spot BOND...one of them,
       with a briefcase and a suit and tie...HOLD on his face,
       troubled.

       INT. HOTEL - GENEVA - DAY

       The Cigar Girl enters a huge, high-ceilinged room. Edgy, she
       approaches a BIG MAN standing on a balcony overlooking the
       city.  Propped against the doorframe, an assassin’s RIFLE
       with LASER-SIGHT attached. BINOCULARS are on a tripod,
       trained on the rooftop below where we can see cops examining
       the shattered office windows.

       The man turns. Powerful, deadly, with a military haircut.
       There is a raised, red scar of an ENTRY WOUND at his temple.
       It throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression,
       like an insect living just beneath his skin. One EYE seems
       slightly drooping, deadened. The other eye is sharp and black
       as anthracite.  It is a frightening face. This is RENARD.

                           RENARD
                 What’s his name? Our friend from MI-6?

                           CIGAR GIRL
                 James Bond.

                           RENARD
                 One of M’s more accomplished tin
                 soldiers.

                           CIGAR GIRL
                 He could identify me.

                           RENARD
                 If it concerns you...kill him.

       He touches her cheek and moves into the room, pouring two
       glasses of wine.

                           RENARD
                 Let’s toast this James Bond.  We’re in
                 his hands now...

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. RIVER THAMES - LONDON - DAY

       A SEAPLANE swoops over the Millennium Dome, banks along the
       snaking river.

       EXT. MI-6 - LONDON - DAY

       Tate Gallery in background, the seaplane moors beneath the
       vast stepped cake that is MI-6.  Bond exits with the
       suitcase.
